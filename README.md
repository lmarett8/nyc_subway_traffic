## Problem Statement

<Introductory paragraph about NYC subways>
    
Our goals for this project are to
1) visualize the data overlayed on a map of NYC
2) model the time-series data to make predictions about foot traffic at various stations
3) develop a basic web app that people could access to determine the lowest traffic/destination station passenger load - this could help people choose less busy times to travel when possible to prevent the spread of COVID, for instance.

Given that we are forecasting, we plan to optimize for R-squared, Mean Absolute Percentage Error, and Root Mean Squared Error with our modeling.
